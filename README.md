# What-Is-This
This is a java runner file written in python. It compile and runs packages actually. I had a problem that java ides were slow and my computer, slower, so I made these two programs to run packages as well as java files so i wont need ide to run the package.<br>

# How-Does-It-Work
The run-t.py automatically searches the whole package and finds the java file that contains main method, then runs it. This file is appropriate for GUI programs.<br>
The run-o.py gets the java files you give as a argument and runs it.<br>
Note: don't add ".java" at the end of the name.<br>

# How-To-Use
Simply put each one you want in the package you're gonna compile and run and follow the instructions I gave.<br>

Note: You can also put them in the system path, then run them through terminal like a command. for example:
  $ runp
